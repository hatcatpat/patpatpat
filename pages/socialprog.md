# the social responsibility of a programmer

## definitions

* a **programmer** is anyone who creates or distributes software
* **social responsibility** is your duty to others. it is the actions you take to benefit the society you inhabit

## what

**programmers** (by and large) are not bound by any strict guidelines or
code-of-ethics or governing body. if you create a software that is legally
unethical, morally dubious, and technically flawed - no one will stop you.

it is our own morality that must decide what we should do and what we should not
do.

## non-examples

it may be clearer to explore some non-examples: i.e., actions of **socially
irresponsible** programmers

#### massive, personalised, and unwarranted data collection
- this includes sharing it with unnecessary 3rd parties
- this data is liable to leaks and/or hacks. the only safe data is no data

#### [social media] deliberate advertising policies or inadequate moderation, resulting in:
- proliferation of misinformation, due to malice and/or stupidity. often this includes hate speech
- endangering children

#### inconsiderate denial of service, which can take the form of:
- unexpected or unreasonably modified fees
- planned obsolescence and denying the right-to-repair
- enforcing artificial hardware constraints

#### bloat, which includes:
- adding unnecessary out-of-scope features
- wilfully ignoring code re-usability
- wilfully ignoring file size, memory usage, and cpu usage
- requiring massive 3rd party libraries for things that could be implemented manually
- overly convoluted build systems
- [caveat] software is difficult, build systems are difficult, cross-platform development is difficult. completely suckless software is rare. this section is really, "things to consider", rather than strict rules
