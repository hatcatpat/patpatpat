	<h1>the social responsibility of a programmer</h1>
<h2>definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>programmer</strong> is anyone who creates or distributes software</li>
<li><strong>social responsibility</strong> is your duty to others. it is the actions you take to benefit the society you inhabit</li>
</ul>
<h2>what</h2>
<p><strong>programmers</strong> (by and large) are not bound by any strict guidelines or
code-of-ethics or governing body. if you create a software that is legally
unethical, morally dubious, and technically flawed - no one will stop you.</p>
<p>it is our own morality that must decide what we should do and what we should not
do.</p>
<h2>non-examples</h2>
<p>it may be clearer to explore some non-examples: i.e., actions of <strong>socially
irresponsible</strong> programmers</p>
<h4>massive, personalised, and unwarranted data collection</h4>
<ul>
<li>this includes sharing it with unnecessary 3rd parties</li>
<li>this data is liable to leaks and/or hacks. the only safe data is no data</li>
</ul>
<h4>[social media] deliberate advertising policies or inadequate moderation, resulting in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>proliferation of misinformation, due to malice and/or stupidity. often this includes hate speech</li>
<li>endangering children</li>
</ul>
<h4>inconsiderate denial of service, which can take the form of:</h4>
<ul>
<li>unexpected or unreasonably modified fees</li>
<li>planned obsolescence and denying the right-to-repair</li>
<li>enforcing artificial hardware constraints</li>
</ul>
<h4>bloat, which includes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>adding unnecessary out-of-scope features</li>
<li>wilfully ignoring code re-usability</li>
<li>wilfully ignoring file size, memory usage, and cpu usage</li>
<li>requiring massive 3rd party libraries for things that could be implemented manually</li>
<li>overly convoluted build systems</li>
<li>[caveat] software is difficult, build systems are difficult, cross-platform development is difficult. completely suckless software is rare. this section is really, &quot;things to consider&quot;, rather than strict rules</li>
</ul>
