<h2>uxn</h2>
<p>my exploration began when i discovered the <strong>uxn</strong> virtual machine +
language, made by the ingenious and oft eccentric duo of swashbuckling
techno-sailors known as <strong>hundred rabbits</strong>. the <strong>uxn</strong> project
consists of a stack machine with:</p>
<ul>
<li>256 bytes of working stack, and 256 bytes of return stack</li>
<li>64kb of ram</li>
<li>32 opcodes</li>
<li>16 devices, each with 16 bytes of memory</li>
</ul>
<p>on top of this, they have created a <strong>forth</strong> style language called
<strong>uxntal</strong>. at its core <strong>uxntal</strong>, and in fact all programming
languages, are simply an elaborate series of <strong>push/pop</strong> and
<strong>read/write</strong> calls: i.e, adding/removing things from the stack or
storing/reading things from memory</p>
<p>finally, they had to create a program to emulate this
<strong>virtual machine</strong>. the approach is the exact same as an emulator for
any <strong>physical machine</strong> (like a game boy, nes, n64, etc). you set up
all the required data, you connect up all the required <em>devices</em>, and
just like that bob is quite firmly your uncle. the folks over at
<strong>hundred rabbits</strong> made a perfectly good emulator called
<strong>varvara</strong></p>
<p>you may well be thinking &quot;isn't it a bit overkill to create an entire virtual
machine just to make a program/game?&quot;, and the answer to that thought is,
maybe. however, the magic of this approach lies in the emulator. okay, so
lets imagine that you are (hypothetically) using a <em>brand new</em> (or
<em>brand old</em> i guess) operating system called <em>pat-os</em>, but
<strong>varvara</strong> only works on linux, mac, and windows. you may very well be
thinking, &quot;great, all my old <strong>uxn</strong> programs are useless :(&quot;. but fret
not, my dear, for <strong>virtual machines</strong> are magical and wondrous things!
all you have to do is write a new <em>emulator</em>, not a new program. in fact,
you don't even have to look at a single line of <strong>uxntal</strong>. you just
have to find a <em>pat-os</em> way of implementing the various stacks, memory
stores and devices. once you've done that, any and all
<strong>uxntal</strong> programs will work exactly the same as before: provided you
do it correctly, which i have absolute faith that you will</p>
<h2>chip8</h2>
<p>i may seem cheery now (with the delicious strawberry aftertaste of hindsight),
but at the time this all seemed to me like an absurdly impossible task. and
so, i went searching for the oracles of the internet. they told me (through
various visions and dreams) to gaze upon <em>chip8</em></p>
<p><strong>chip8</strong> is an 8bit virtual machine and language from the 70's, and it
was designed for an obscure home computer called the <em>cosmac vip</em>. why
then, i hear you ask, did the oracles recommend such an archaic system? the
answer, my dear friends, is that the <strong>chip8</strong> is a perfect example of
what a virtual machine <em>actually</em> is. in fact, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip-8">wikipedia</a> page is all you
need to create a <strong>chip8</strong> emulator for yourself!</p>
<h3>first, the hardware:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>memory: the <strong>chip8</strong> has <strong>0x1000</strong> bytes of memory, and
traditionally the first <strong>0x200</strong> bytes contained the interpreter itself.
this means that our program (and all the 'data' like sprites, fonts, etc)
must be contained within the range (<strong>0x200</strong>,<strong>0x1000</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>registers: there are <strong>16</strong> registers (<strong>v0</strong> to <strong>vf</strong>),
however the last register is also used as a flag for some operations. for
instance, if you change a pixel (from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0</strong>, or from
<strong>0</strong> to <strong>1</strong>), vf will be set to <strong>1</strong>. there is also an 'address
register' called <strong>i</strong>, which is <strong>12</strong> bits. and finally, a 'program
counter' called <strong>pc</strong> which records the current 'line' (in this case,
the byte) that the program is on</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>(return) stack</em>: this stack is used to return from a function (i.e,
its a stack that only stores addresses to functions), and is large enough to
go <strong>12</strong> functions deep</p>
</li>
<li><p>timers: the <strong>chip8</strong> has <strong>2</strong> 'timers', which are
numbers that decrease at <strong>60hz</strong>: one is used as a generic timer, and
one controls the sound</p>
</li>
<li><p>input: there are <strong>16</strong> keys [<strong>0</strong>,<strong>f</strong>], each stored as
single bit</p>
</li>
<li><p>video/audio: the screen is <strong>64x32</strong> <strong>1bit</strong> color, and you
draw to it using sprites of width <strong>8</strong> and height in the range
[<strong>1</strong>,<strong>16</strong>]. the audio is a painful beep, and is enabled whenever
the sound timer is non-zero</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>now, the software:</h3>
<p>okay, now that the hardware is out of the way...how do we program the dang
thing? well, we use <strong>opcodes</strong> of course! everyone loves
<strong>opcodes</strong>. an <strong>opcode</strong> is just a number that represents an
instruction. i.e <strong>7 = pet dog</strong>, <strong>42 = kill jester</strong>, etc etc.
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip-8">wikipedia</a>
entry (is excellent) and lists all of the <strong>35</strong>
<strong>opcodes</strong>, as well as a c-pseudo code implementation of each. note:
<strong>uxntal</strong> only has 32 <strong>opcodes</strong>!</p>
<p>a <em>program</em> then, is simply a list of <strong>opcodes</strong>. the following
describes how to <em>run</em> a program:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>load the program into memory (i.e, by reading a file, or a floppy disk, or a
vinyl, or a stone tablet, etc)</p>
</li>
<li><p>reset the <strong>registers</strong>, <strong>pc = 0; i = 0; v0 = 0; ... vf = 0;</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>read the first byte of the program. oh look, its <strong>0x6034</strong>! i love
<strong>0x6034</strong>! this is an <strong>opcode</strong> which means &quot;set <strong>v0</strong> to
the data stored at the <strong>0x34</strong>-th byte of our program&quot;. i.e, the
<strong>6</strong> means &quot;set&quot;, the <strong>0</strong> means &quot;<strong>v0</strong>&quot;, and the
<strong>34</strong> means &quot;<strong>0x34</strong>-th byte of our program&quot; (remember, these
opcodes are all on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip-8">wikipedia</a>
<em>;^)</em> )</p>
</li>
<li><p>okay, we did that <strong>opcode</strong> really well! lets do the next one: to do
this, we have to increment <strong>pc</strong> and then do the <strong>opcode</strong> that
stored in memory at that location</p>
</li>
<li><p>then we just repeat this process forever and foreverever and forevereverever
(well, until we get bored, the program ends, or the heat death of the
universe)</p>
</li>
</ul>
