<em>i don't believe in regrets</em>

<p>
i don't mean in a sort of hippie way, "just, like, live in the now, man", because i have absolutely experienced the <i>feeling</i> of regret.
i've felt that nauseating grip in my stomach, twisting me out like a wet towel; each turn whispering such unpleasantries as, <q>why didn't you do x</q>, and, <q>you're a failure, you failed at x, only a failure would fail at x</q>, etc etc etc.
it teases you with hyper-idealised, perfect and beautiful visions of that oft imagined place - the land of <b>what could have been</b>
</p>

<em>what i do mean, is that it is impossible to anticipate a regret</em>

<p>
regardless of whether you believe we are all being tugged along by the long arm of fate, or the long bytes of a simulation, or the long hairy arm of a generic god, or the many colourful arms of a less generic one, or whatever - the fact of the matter is that your thoughts and/or feelings are determined by your current situation
</p>

<em>time is linear, and so are you</em>

<p>
this means that every decision you make was made in the context of that moment, taking into account all the other information and emotions you currently had available to you.
in my case, often my major decisions were tinted by depression, boredom or loneliness (sometimes, if i was lucky, a bit of all three).
so its all very well-and-good looking back on your choices, from the nice protective time-sphere you find yourself in, and analysing them, optimising them, and generally solving them in a more cool-headed way - because the problem has changed, current-you is no longer solving the same thing that former-you was.
essentially, current-you has been given one of the infinitude of incorrect answers, which statistically makes solving the problem much easier
</p>

<em>you've got to break a few lightbulbs to make an omelette</em>

<p>
so if you ever feel down and start analysing previous choices with poignant phrases like, <q>if i could go back, id do it differently</q>, just remember: if you could go back, you'd find yourself with the exact same brain, with the exact same stimuli, as last time, and would undoubtedly make the same choices again
</p>

<p>
hindsight doesn't help you <i>un-fuck</i> a situation, but it can <i>lessen the fuck</i> of a new one.
your mind is chock full of failures, literally to the brim.
really, its the only way we get anything done around here.
our thoughts undergo evolution, its survival of the fittest up there.
the very fact that you can look back at your previous decisions with new eyes proves that you are learning, that the process is working.
faced with a similar situation, you can try out a new solution. maybe it will turn out better this time
</p>
